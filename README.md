# 24Sp-SYS (ENGR)

This Capstone project advances ongoing research to identify important issues and best practices for managing the mentally ill inmate population based on aggregate data from organizations like Region Ten (R10) and Offender Aid Restoration (OAR) which are local criminal justice agencies. 

This semester has been spent briefing the team on the information beyond the numbers seen on the screen and the reasons for major issues amongst this population.

# Current Status

The team has just received the data needed to begin data exploration and analysis. Over the break, they will be cleaning and extracting information to create a direction for their project. 

# Tech/Framework Used

Data was uploaded to a remote desktop. All analysis is being performed on R. Issues arose with uploading R packages onto the remote desktop but deidentified data was pulled from the remote desktop to local desktops. 

# Notes
